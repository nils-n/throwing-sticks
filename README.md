# A short story about a magic number and throwing sticks 

The number $\pi$ is widely used in probably each and every modern technological device. Yet, its understanding is somehow limited - like a car, we can use it without knowing exactly what it does. This website is an attempt to teach the value of this number in an interactive and fun way.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories 

As a first-time user...
<ol>
    <li> I want a to learn about &pi; by exploring data interactively so that my learning experience is fun.</li>
    <li> I have never heard about &pi; and i am curious to learn what makes this number special. </li>
    <li> I am aware of the value of &pi;  but i never liked the dull, academic style how it is taught on other websites. Visiting this website, i want to refresh my memory in a fun way what this number was all about. </li>
    <li> I want a friendly, entertaining website so that i can show it to my friends or children and motivate them to learn more about math. </li>
</ol>

### Website Aims

<ul>
    <li> Motive a change to the dull academic-style websites by using modern web technologies </li>
    <li> Advertise the value of &pi; in a fun, interactive and exploratory way </li>
    <li> Promote the art of coding by showcasing modern browser technologies </li>
    <li> Provide accurate and correct information </li>
</ul>

### How these needs are addressed

- All possible user scenarios and potential needs were identified and documented. 
- The user needs to feel instantly a positive emotion and should know instantly what to expect from this website. 
- THIS IS A WIP 

### Opportunities 

| Description                            | Impact | Feasibility | 
|----------------------------------------|--------|-------------|
| Promote Math and the value of &pi;     | 5      | 5           | 
| Entertain the users                    | 5      | 5           | 
| Animate the calulation of Pi using thrown sticks in JS  | 5      | 5           | 
| Animate the explanations using JS      | 5      | 5          | 
| ~~Do large-scale simulation (> 10e6 sticks)~~  | 2   | 1    | 
| **Sum**                          | **20**   | **20**     | 

### Feature selection

- The sum of Impact/Feasibility is balanced after discarding the entry "Do large-scale simulation (> 10e6 sticks)".
-  This had to be discarded because it is currently not feasible without using dedicated simulation software (i.e. [Processing](https://processing.org/)) or running the simulation on a backend server - which is beyond the scope of this project. 
- I figured that for educational purposes, an animation of ~1000 sticks the simulation can be handled by most browsers using d3.js and would still lead to a sufficient approximation of &pi; .

### Future Implementations

- Estimate $\pi$ using similar heuristical methods ( see example  [here](https://academo.org/demos/estimating-pi-monte-carlo/) )
- compare these estimates using interactive charts (i.e. for efficiency, run-time, stability)
- visualize  how to derive $\pi$ in a graphical or algebraic way 
- visualize other intersting numbers such as $\phi$ (golden ratio), or the  Euler number, or $\tau$

## Testing 

### Testing Procedure 
The website was tested extensively for several apsects , and the results were documented in [TO DO TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) 

 - Functionality
 - User Stories
- Usability and Accessibility 
- Compatibility and Responsiveness 

### Solved Bugs 
- the `d3` library would cause `jest` unit test to fail with a `Reference Error: d3 is not defined`. It was not easy to fix this since documentation about unit testing and d3 is sparse. The solution was not to import `d3.js` via a script but by installing through `npm install d3 --save-dev` and commenting out the web-import
- This still did not work as it caused a ` SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` inside the unit test module . The problem was the line `import * as d3 from "d3"` causing an `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'`. The unit test finally passes with solutions from (Link to [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69226759/jest-unexpected-token-export-when-using-d3)) to map to the minified build of `d3` and (Link to [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9948350/how-to-use-d3-in-node-js-properly)) and to load the `d3` library using `const d3 = require('d3');`
- The functions were tested correctly in `jest` - but trying to call them in the browser caused a error `Uncaught ReferenceError: module is not defined`. This problem was mentioned in the Code Institute slack channel (`#project-miletone-2`, 18.April 2022 'automated testing (as per requirements) causing an this error"). The solution was (I am not 100% sure if that is the case) to modify the `module:exports statement` and the import on the `diagram.test.js` side.
- Now all unit test pass also with functions that use the `d3`. But when opening the script in the browser, I am getting an `Uncaught ReferenceError: module is not defined` which is caused by the `module.exports`. It seems like (see [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64914701/jest-module-not-defined)) that I am using `node.js` syntax for my unit test which the browser does not understand. Bummer! I do want to follow TDD development as a learning experience for this project, but i also want to make it run without errors in the browser - so not using TDD was not a solution for me. 
- The final clue gave this Youtube Tutorial [15. Install Jest Testing Framework with npm for ES6 module support - JavaScript Testing](https://youtu.be/ZnIv8u2-XrA). The problem above was caused by a conflict of two types of Javascript (commonJS and ES6), where commonJS is required for testing with JEST and ES6 for scripts that run in the browser. The solution to this problem as per [this Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/ZnIv8u2-XrA) was to install `babel`. According to this tutorial, the way to solve this problem was :
    - go to the `babel.js` website > `Setup` 
    - click on `Jest`
    - in gitpod, create a `.babelrc` file in the root directory with content 
        ```
        {
            "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
        }
        ```
    - install babel preset with `npm install @babel/preset-env --save-dev` (as mentioned on website)
- This passes now successfully the unit test and allows import/export via the `export function` command into `jest`. But when i tried to add an eventlistener to invoke a function that is being testing with `Jest`, the console would throw an error `Uncaught ReferenceError: buttonClick is not defined`. The solution to that was to **not** import the javascript file that is tested by `jest` into the browser that is being tested. Instead, the way to go was to create a new `main.js` that **imports** the (successfully tested) functions, adds an event listener to the button and calls the imported `buttonClick` function. Heureka!
- While functions without `d3` are now running correctly in the browser and can be tested with `jest`, my previous approach to test functions that use `d3` in `jest` failed with an error message (`SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'` of the named export. The problem here is now that we are using ES6 syntax in our function (see `diagram.js`) but jest runs in `node.js`. A solution to this problem was hinted here : [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72893900/how-to-import-d3-js-in-a-node-and-typescript-project-err-require-esm) . Thi post recommends (until further notice) to use the last stable build of `d3` that worked under `node.js`. Since this project here does not require any latest features of `d3`, I followed the adivse and used `v6.7.0`.
