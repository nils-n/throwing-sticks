# A short story about a magic number and throwing sticks 

The number $\pi$ is widely used in probably each and every modern technological device. Yet, its understanding is somehow limited - like a car, we can use it without knowing exactly what it does. This website is an attempt to teach the value of this number in an interactive and fun way.
