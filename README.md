# A short story about a magic number and throwing sticks 

The number $\pi$ is widely used in probably each and every modern technological device. Yet, its understanding is somehow limited - like a car, we can use it without knowing exactly what it does. This website is an attempt to teach the value of this number in an interactive and fun way.

| **Sum**                          | **20**   | **20**     | 

### Feature selection

- The sum of Impact/Feasibility is balanced after discarding the entry "Do large-scale simulation (> 10e6 sticks)".
-  This had to be discarded because it is currently not feasible without using dedicated simulation software (i.e. [Processing](https://processing.org/)) or running the simulation on a backend server - which is beyond the scope of this project. 
- I figured that for educational purposes, an animation of ~1000 sticks the simulation can be handled by most browsers using d3.js and would still lead to a sufficient approximation of &pi; .
- It was consciously chosen to develop the Javascript using a `test-driven development` (TDD) approach. While it was not strictly necessary to do this, in my opinion this approach enforced clean coding, small functions, and less likelihood for errors - which greatly enhanced readibility and maintainability of the code. It came with a small risk since i just started programming with Javascript, but in retrospective it turned out extremly valuable. 
- During the implementation, I have come to realize that implementing a `test-driven` approach for front-end display of the simulation is better suited within a framework such as `React`.  The history of the struggle with `d3` unit test using `jest` was documented in [ this section](./SETUP.md).
 I left this up for future extension as this would be beyond the current scope of the project. As consequence, unit testing of all front-end elements using `d3.js` was reduced to checking correct inputs (and not the actual rendering inside the DOM).

## Testing 

### Testing Procedure 
The website was tested extensively for several apsects , and the results were documented in [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) 

- Functionality
- User Stories
- Usability and Accessibility 
- Compatibility and Responsiveness 

Also, this website was developed using a `test-driven development` (TDD) approach using the `JEST` framework for javascript. Results of of the unit tests are documented in same document above. The reasons for TDD is to 
- ... ensure core functionality
- ... better code re-usability 
- ... better code readibility by enforcing smaller functions.

(clean code principles).

### Solved Bugs 

- There is a a separate document in this repository that describes in more details :  [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) 
    - This  [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)  document describes the majority of bugs encountered during the setup of of this project.
    - it also documents the successful and unsuccessful solution approaches, and provides a justification for the final resolution strategy that was eventually applied to this project.  
    - the majority of the bugs occured while trying to setup an javascript environment that can be tested with a unit testing framework such as `Jest`, works in the browser (conflict between `commonJS` and `ES` modules), and poses no security risk from using external libaries such as `d3.js`
- There was a bug of a wrongly designed test that created false positive test result. The test was for randomness of the orientation of new stick. It was designed to assert that an array of `100` sticks had unique orientations. This approach was inspired by a hint from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57001262/jest-expect-only-unique-elements-in-an-array)
  to test that the `Array` length equals the lenght of the array converted to a `Set` (if there was a duplicate, the `size of Set <  Array Length`)). However, in my implementation of the `for` loop i switched the the second and third entry, which casuses the loop to run exaclty `1 times` - with the consequence that `Array Length` is always equal to `Set Size`!
    - The solution was to correct the order of loop header in the `simulation.test.js`, and now the test failed as expected. 
- For debugging, i wanted to test the Simulation classes also in the browser. However, `main.js` could not be loaded in the browser and fails with a `ReferenceError: module is not defined`. A hint to the solution was found in this article  [How To Fix ReferenceError require is not defined in JavaScript](https://isotropic.co/how-to-fix-referenceerror-require-is-not-defined-in-javascript/) that suggests to use `browserify`:
    -  Following the docmentation of [browserify](https://browserify.org/), the problem is fixed by bundling into a `bundle.js` and then importing this bundled file as `<script>` into the `index.html` :
        ```bash
        npm install -g browserify
        npm install uniq
        browserify main.js -o bundle.js
        ```
- This bundling works for individual files with files that use `require` - but it failed with same `Reference error - require not defined` with scripts that have  nested imports such as the `Simulation` class from `simulation.js`. The solution was to check out a solution in this README from a previous bugfix (as described in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)) to use `webpack` instead to create a compiled version of the vanilla javascript file. The small downside is, now we have to manually compile the javascript files before using them in the browser - but this is acceptable since it does not affect the final website, only the development workflow.
    ```
        bash
        npm run build
    ```
- Functions related to drawing the `d3.js` outputs of the simulation such as`drawEmptyDisplay` or `drawMidlines` would either draw at wrong locations or log errors such as `Error: <svg> attribute width: Expected length, "NaN".` This was caused when calling it with a previous version of this function that would occasionaly use different global parameter such as `width` or `height` that would be overwritten at various points in the code. The soltuion was to refactor the code into a `DisplayConfiguration` class that handles the sizing and positioning of the elements on the screen (without actually drawing them). In this way, the `TDD` approach of implementing functions that use `d3.js` was still at least partially achieved.
- During Manual Testing using the WebAIM Accessibility Checker, it turned out that the sliders did not have associated `aria` labels, which would make this website impossible to interact for users with visual impairments. Adding the apropriate `aria-labels`, the validation passes. 

- The Unit test failed against the expectation when calculating the `position` of a `Stick`:

| Description     | Problem       | Solution |
| -------- |:------------:| ------:|
| Unit test failed in `stick.test.js`   |  <img src="./assets/testing/solved-issues/6-unit-test-matcher.png" alt="image of bug" style='max-width:500px'>    | use a more apropriate matcher `toBeCloseTo` to assert equality of floating point values | |

### Solved Visualization Bugs

Additionally, there was a multitude of bugs to be fixed for the visual display of the simulation. A collection of them will be discussed in the table below.  

| #     | Bug Decription       | Solution | Result |
| -------- |:------------:| ------:|------:|
| 1     |   The sticks were simulated correctly, but not distributed on screen   |  introduce a `sector` property of the `Stick` class that assigns a stick randomly to a sector between midlines. Since the simulation takes place with 0 and 1, this was just a cosmetic operation to make the output look nicer.  | <img src="./assets/testing/solved-issues/1-not-distributed.png" alt="image of bug" style="min-width:400px">   |
| 2    |   SVG of first diagram does not use full width of parent container  | update `width` of SVG from a hard-coded `200px` to use global `window.clientWidth` property  | <img src="./assets/testing/solved-issues/2-small-svg.png" alt="image of bug" style="min-width:400px">   |
| 3   |  After translating the sticks to their position , `d3-rotate` would rotate around svg origin (0,0) | add for rotating not in the origin, do `d3-translate` first and then `d3-rotate` to adjust center of rotation for `d3` | <img src="./assets/testing/solved-issues/3-wrong-rotation.png" alt="image of bug" style="min-width:400px">   |
| 4   |  First and last midline would fit only half of their stroke width in the SVG | add `viewBox` property to the `d3` SVG selector | <img src="./assets/testing/solved-issues/4-first-last-midline.png" alt="image of bug" style="min-width:400px">   |
| 5   |  The displayed stick lenght would be too short | fix error : axial radius of `d3-ellipse` was scaled by `2`. After removing, sticks displayed correctly. | <img src="./assets/testing/solved-issues/7-stick-length.png" alt="image of bug" style="min-width:400px">   |
| 6  | The color of a stick on the screen would not match the expected color  | this was actually not just a simple fix. It had to do with `stickLengthOnScreen` and `distanceBetweenMidLines`. The actual solution consisted in creating a `DisplayConfiguration` class that handles the lenghts. Here, `TDD` helped a lot since i could just test stick positions that i `knew` the color of : for example, the position of the midline itself or the position in the middle of two midlines - sticks are `always` green there no matter the angle.  | <img src="./assets/testing/solved-issues/5-wrong-scaling-x.png" alt="image of bug" style="min-width:400px; max-width:500px">   |
