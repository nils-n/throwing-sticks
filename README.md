# A short story about a magic number and throwing sticks 

The number $\pi$ is widely used in probably each and every modern technological device. Yet, its understanding is somehow limited - like a car, we can use it without knowing exactly what it does. This website is an attempt to teach the value of this number in an interactive and fun way.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories 

As a first-time user...
<ol>
    <li> I want a to learn about &pi; by exploring data interactively so that my learning experience is fun.</li>
    <li> I have never heard about &pi; and i am curious to learn what makes this number special. </li>
    <li> I am aware of the value of &pi;  but i never liked the dull, academic style how it is taught on other websites. Visiting this website, i want to refresh my memory in a fun way what this number was all about. </li>
    <li> I want a friendly, entertaining website so that i can show it to my friends or children and motivate them to learn more about math. </li>
</ol>

### Website Aims

<ul>
    <li> Motive a change to the dull academic-style websites by using modern web technologies </li>
    <li> Advertise the value of &pi; in a fun, interactive and exploratory way </li>
    <li> Promote the art of coding by showcasing modern browser technologies </li>
    <li> Provide accurate and correct information </li>
</ul>

### How these needs are addressed

- All possible user scenarios and potential needs were identified and documented. 
- The user needs to feel instantly a positive emotion and should know instantly what to expect from this website. 
- THIS IS A WIP 

### Opportunities 

| Description                            | Impact | Feasibility | 
|----------------------------------------|--------|-------------|
| Promote Math and the value of &pi;     | 5      | 5           | 
| Entertain the users                    | 5      | 5           | 
| Animate the calulation of Pi using thrown sticks in JS  | 5      | 5           | 
| Animate the explanations using JS      | 5      | 5          | 
| ~~Do large-scale simulation (> 10e6 sticks)~~  | 2   | 1    | 
| **Sum**                          | **20**   | **20**     | 

### Feature selection

- The sum of Impact/Feasibility is balanced after discarding the entry "Do large-scale simulation (> 10e6 sticks)".
-  This had to be discarded because it is currently not feasible without using dedicated simulation software (i.e. [Processing](https://processing.org/)) or running the simulation on a backend server - which is beyond the scope of this project. 
- I figured that for educational purposes, an animation of ~1000 sticks the simulation can be handled by most browsers using d3.js and would still lead to a sufficient approximation of &pi; .

### Future Implementations

- Estimate $\pi$ using similar heuristical methods ( see example  [here](https://academo.org/demos/estimating-pi-monte-carlo/) )
- compare these estimates using interactive charts (i.e. for efficiency, run-time, stability)
- visualize  how to derive $\pi$ in a graphical or algebraic way 
- visualize other intersting numbers such as $\phi$ (golden ratio), or the  Euler number, or $\tau$
