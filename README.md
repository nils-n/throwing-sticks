# A short story about a magic number and throwing sticks 

The number $\pi$ is widely used in probably each and every modern technological device. Yet, its understanding is somehow limited - like a car, we can use it without knowing exactly what it does. This website is an attempt to teach the value of this number in an interactive and fun way.

| ~~Do large-scale simulation (> 10e6 sticks)~~  | 2   | 1    | 
| **Sum**                          | **20**   | **20**     | 

### Feature selection

- The sum of Impact/Feasibility is balanced after discarding the entry "Do large-scale simulation (> 10e6 sticks)".
-  This had to be discarded because it is currently not feasible without using dedicated simulation software (i.e. [Processing](https://processing.org/)) or running the simulation on a backend server - which is beyond the scope of this project. 
- I figured that for educational purposes, an animation of ~1000 sticks the simulation can be handled by most browsers using d3.js and would still lead to a sufficient approximation of &pi; .
- It was consciously chosen to develop the Javascript using a `test-driven development` (TDD) approach. While it was not strictly necessary to do this, in my opinion this approach enforced clean coding, small functions, and less likelihood for errors - which greatly enhanced readibility and maintainability of the code. It came with a small risk since i just started programming with Javascript, but in retrospective it turned out extremly valuable. 
- During the implementation, I have come to realize that implementing a `test-driven` approach for front-end display of the simulation is better suited within a framework such as `React`.  The history of the struggle with `d3` unit test using `jest` was documented in [ this section](./SETUP.md).
 I left this up for future extension as this would be beyond the current scope of the project. As consequence, unit testing of all front-end elements using `d3.js` was reduced to checking correct inputs (and not the actual rendering inside the DOM).

## Design

### Color Scheme
A neutral colour tone was selected to create an inviting, positive atmosphere. Three colors were chosen as sufficient to be used on the website. The reason for the small number of colors was to not overload the user with visual information and keep distractions to a minimum:

- White was chosen as Background 
- Dark Gray was chosen instead of black as it looked less aggressive and did not fit the playful intention of the website 
- Blue Green was chosen by using the [Color Palette Generator](https://mycolor.space/). As input, the wooden color tone of the hero image was used. Then, the `Blue Green` was selected as one of the complementary colors.

### Typography

Classic Fonts were selected to add to a professional, clean tone. Font pairs were generated using [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/). Font chosen were : 


- For the main heading  (`<h1>` element)  : Catamaran, Font-weight 900, Font-size 3.5 rem
-  For sub-headings ( `<h2>` - `<h6>`): Musli , Font-weight 700, Font-size 3 rem
- For text on the body  : Roboto Slab, Font-weight 400, Font-size , 1.2 rem

## Testing 

### Testing Procedure 
The website was tested extensively for several apsects , and the results were documented in [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) 

- Functionality
- User Stories
- Usability and Accessibility 
- Compatibility and Responsiveness 

Also, this website was developed using a `test-driven development` (TDD) approach using the `JEST` framework for javascript. Results of of the unit tests are documented in same document above. The reasons for TDD is to 
- ... ensure core functionality
- ... better code re-usability 
- ... better code readibility by enforcing smaller functions.

(clean code principles).

### Solved Bugs 

- There is a a separate document in this repository that describes in more details :  [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) 
    - This  [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)  document describes the majority of bugs encountered during the setup of of this project.
    - it also documents the successful and unsuccessful solution approaches, and provides a justification for the final resolution strategy that was eventually applied to this project.  
    - the majority of the bugs occured while trying to setup an javascript environment that can be tested with a unit testing framework such as `Jest`, works in the browser (conflict between `commonJS` and `ES` modules), and poses no security risk from using external libaries such as `d3.js`
- There was a bug of a wrongly designed test that created false positive test result. The test was for randomness of the orientation of new stick. It was designed to assert that an array of `100` sticks had unique orientations. This approach was inspired by a hint from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57001262/jest-expect-only-unique-elements-in-an-array)
  to test that the `Array` length equals the lenght of the array converted to a `Set` (if there was a duplicate, the `size of Set <  Array Length`)). However, in my implementation of the `for` loop i switched the the second and third entry, which casuses the loop to run exaclty `1 times` - with the consequence that `Array Length` is always equal to `Set Size`!
    - The solution was to correct the order of loop header in the `simulation.test.js`, and now the test failed as expected. 
- For debugging, i wanted to test the Simulation classes also in the browser. However, `main.js` could not be loaded in the browser and fails with a `ReferenceError: module is not defined`. A hint to the solution was found in this article  [How To Fix ReferenceError require is not defined in JavaScript](https://isotropic.co/how-to-fix-referenceerror-require-is-not-defined-in-javascript/) that suggests to use `browserify`:
    -  Following the docmentation of [browserify](https://browserify.org/), the problem is fixed by bundling into a `bundle.js` and then importing this bundled file as `<script>` into the `index.html` :
        ```bash
        npm install -g browserify
        npm install uniq
        browserify main.js -o bundle.js
        ```
- This bundling works for individual files with files that use `require` - but it failed with same `Reference error - require not defined` with scripts that have  nested imports such as the `Simulation` class from `simulation.js`. The solution was to check out a solution in this README from a previous bugfix (as described in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)) to use `webpack` instead to create a compiled version of the vanilla javascript file. The small downside is, now we have to manually compile the javascript files before using them in the browser - but this is acceptable since it does not affect the final website, only the development workflow.
    ```
        bash
        npm run build
    ```
- Functions related to drawing the `d3.js` outputs of the simulation such as`drawEmptyDisplay` or `drawMidlines` would either draw at wrong locations or log errors such as `Error: <svg> attribute width: Expected length, "NaN".` This was caused when calling it with a previous version of this function that would occasionaly use different global parameter such as `width` or `height` that would be overwritten at various points in the code. The soltuion was to refactor the code into a `DisplayConfiguration` class that handles the sizing and positioning of the elements on the screen (without actually drawing them). In this way, the `TDD` approach of implementing functions that use `d3.js` was still at least partially achieved.
- During Manual Testing using the WebAIM Accessibility Checker, it turned out that the sliders did not have associated `aria` labels, which would make this website impossible to interact for users with visual impairments. Adding the apropriate `aria-labels`, the validation passes. 

- The Unit test failed against the expectation when calculating the `position` of a `Stick`:

| Description     | Problem       | Solution |
| -------- |:------------:| ------:|
| Unit test failed in `stick.test.js`   |  <img src="./assets/testing/solved-issues/6-unit-test-matcher.png" alt="image of bug" style='max-width:500px'>    | use a more apropriate matcher `toBeCloseTo` to assert equality of floating point values | | 

- adding the `aria-valuemin` and `aria-valuemax`  to the sliders in order to increase accessiblity of the site made the website fail the W2C HTML validation. The errors were : `Error: The aria-valuemin attribute must not be used on an element which has a min attribute.`. This problem was solved according [W3C : ARIA in HTML - test cases for aria-valuemin](https://w3c.github.io/html-aria/tests/min-test.html) by removing the these attributes again, and instead use only the attribute `aria-valuenow`for all sliders.

The actual solution consisted in creating a `DisplayConfiguration` class that handles the lenghts.

### open Bugs 

Going through manual testing of the application, I encountered a few bugs that i decided to leave unsolved, but documented. These bugs 
- do not affect the correctness of the simulation
- are only minor display issues that would probably be resolved when switching to a more appropriate front-end framework such as `vue` or `react`. 
- are not significant regarding the scope of the project.

        <td>The sticks can flow out of the displayed canvas </td>
        <td>This has something to do how `d3.js` draws elements onto an svg. Eventually this should be handled better by setting appropriate margins and the use of `d3-translate` but this seemed not a trivial operation, outside the scope of the project. </td>

        <td>The simulation uses angles from 0 to 180, but the diagram shows angles from 0 to 90. It's just that this curve is nicer to look at in this range. Plotting this curve from 0 to 180 would lead to a mirrored curve that adds more to confusion than it helps to understand the point of the diagram. With more time, i could have mapped the simulated angles from 90 to 180 into the diagram - but again, I don't have the time to properly develop the tests for that, and it would not add any extra value.</td>
