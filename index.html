          <h1>A short story about a magic number and sticks on a table</h1>
          <p>
            Once upon a time, there was a magic number that no one understood.
            Her name was Pi. One day, she met a group of sticks that played the
            following game:

          </div>
          <!-- this is based on  https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp -->
          <div class="slidecontainer">
            <input
              type="range"
              min="1"
              max="100"
              value="1"
              class="slider"
              id="myRange"
              aria-label="slider to control number of sticks per throw"
              aria-valuenow="50"
            />
            <p><span id="slider-count"> 1 </span> per Throw</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The sticks jumped on a table with black marks with their eyes
            closed. If they opened their eyes and saw that they touched the
            line, they would turn green. If they would not touch the line, they
            would turn red.
          </p>
          <p>
            The magic number counted <span id="red-sticks">0</span> red and
            <span id="green-sticks">0</span> green sticks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-than-3"></span>

      </div>

      <div class="container text-panel">
        <h2>Can it be true?</h2>
        <p>
          The magic number wondered: How did the sticks know her? One of the
          sticks sat next to her and explained: “Look at us. We are all 1 metre
          tall. The marks on the floor are 1 meter apart. Would you not agree
          that we all have the same chance to touch a line?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Pi wondered. Yes, that has occurred to her. The stick drew a circle in
          the sand to explain more . “When we fall on the ground, we can point
          in any direction we want. But only a few directions will us to touch a
          line. Try to change the <span class="important"> Angle </span> on the
          diagram below!”

            </div>
            <div>
              <span>Position</span>
              <input
                type="range"
                min="50"

                value="360"
                class="slider"
                id="explain-move"
                aria-label="slider to control position of an example stick"
                aria-valuenow="360"

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="container text-panel">
        <h2>What’s your angle, Pi?</h2>
        <p>
          Ok, Pi thought, but she could not see what this has to do with her. It
          could be any number... Or not? The stick pointed on the diagram on the
          sand and explained: “I have a challenge for you, Pi. Can you find a
          position where we are always red, no matter at which angle? And
          another positon where we are always green?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Try to move <span class="important"> Position </span> and
          <span class="important"> Angle </span> in the diagram above to find
          these positions!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container text-panel">
        <h2>This will confuse you, Pi.</h2>

        <p>
          Now the stick stood up. This will confuse you, Pi. Stay with me. Of
          all possible directions, we can find only two different sets of angles
          : angles that touch the line, and angles that doesn’t. Look, i have
          drawn it for all the <span id="total-sticks"></span> sticks that you
          created above, here in the sand. Do you recognise something?”
        </p>
        <div class="diagram bottom-panel">
          <div
            id="scatter-diagram"
            style="max-width: 550px; min-height: 350px"
          ></div>
        </div>

        <p class="important" id='little-advice'></p>

        <p>
          Pi could not believe what is drawn in the sand in front of her. The
          stick has just drawn a picutre of herself, upside down on the sand.
          She was exactly the ratio between red and green sticks. Which means,
          when a stick falls on the lines, it has exactly the chance of 1/pi to
          touch the line!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container text-panel">
        <h2>Pi understood.</h2>
        <p>
          Pi was happy. Finally, she felt understood by someone! When the sticks
          fell on the marks, she <span class="important"> was </span> the
          likelihood that they would turn green or red. Happily, she sat
          together with the sticks playing the game, with the feeling that
          finally someone has understood her.
