                <h1>A short story about a magic number and sticks on a table</h1>
                <p>Once upon a time, there was a magic number that no one understood. Her name was Pi.
                    One day, she met a group of sticks that played the following game: </p>

                <div class="diagram">
                     <div id="main-diagram" style="max-width: 450px; min-height: 200px;" ;></div> 
                     <div class="btn-box">
                        <button id="hero-throw">Throw!</button>
                        <button id="hero-reset">Reset</button>
                     </div>
                </div>
                <!-- this is based on  https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp -->
                <div class="slidecontainer">
                    <input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="50" class="slider" id="myRange">
                    <p><span>1</span> per Throw</p>
                </div>
                <p>The sticks jumped on a table with black marks with their eyes closed.
                    If they opened their eyes and saw that they touched the line, they would turn green. If they would
                    not touch the line, they would turn red. </p>
                <p>After a while, the magic number noticed that the red and green sticks appeared to form always the
                    same number - and this number looked a lot like herself!
                    In happiness and awe she wondered: how can that be?</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container ">
            <h2>Can it be true?</h2>
            <p>The magic number wondered: How did the sticks know her? One of the sticks sat next to her and explained:
                “Look at us. We are all 1 metre tall. The marks on the floor are 1 meter apart. Would you not agree that
                we all have the same chance to touch a line?”</p>
            <p>Pi wondered. Yes, that has occurred to her. The stick drew a circle in the sand to explain more .
                “When we fall on the ground, we can point in any direction we want. But only a few directions will us to
                touch a line!”</p>
            <div class="diagram placeholder-background">
                <button>Click Here</button>
                <button>Reset</button>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>What’s your angle, Pi?</h2>
            <p>Ok, Pi thought, but she could not see what this has to do with her. It could be any number... Or not?
                The stick drew another diagram on the sand. She explained “Look at the angles, Pi. If you look at all
                possible directions we could lie down, have you noticed how many angles allow us to touch the lines?”
            </p>
            <div class="diagram placeholder-background">
                <button>Click Here</button>
                <button>Reset</button>
            </div>
            <p>Yes, Pi agreed. The angle between a stick and a mark would determine whether it would touch or not.
                “Take a closer look at the angle and the distance to the mark, Pi. Do you see how the angle relates to
                its distance?” </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <h2> This will confuse you, Pi.</h2>
            <div class="diagram placeholder-background">
                <button>Click Here</button>
                <button>Reset</button>
            </div>
            <p> Now the stick stood up. This will confuse you, Pi. Stay with me. Of all possible directions, we can find
                only two different sets of angles : angles that touch the line, and angles that doesn’t.
                Look, i have drawn both sets here in the sand. Do you recognise something?” </p>
            <p>Pi could not believe what is drawn in the sand in front of her. The stick has just drawn a picutre of
                herself, upside down on the sand.
                She was exactly the ratio between red and green sticks. Which means, when a stick falls on the lines, it
                has exactly the change of 1/pi to touch the line! </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Pi understood.</h2>
            <p>Pi was happy. Finally, she felt understood by someone! When the sticks fell on the marks, she was the
                likelihood that they would turn green or red.
                Happily, she sat together with the sticks playing the game, with the feeling that finally someone has
                understood her. </p>
