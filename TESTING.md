### Results W3C HTML Validation

In the table below the outputs of the W3C HTML Validation results. All tests passed. 

| Page     | Output       | Result |
| -------- |:------------:| ------:|
| Main     | <img src="./assets/testing/validation-html.png" alt="image of W3C Html Validation result" >  | Pass   |
| 404   |  <img src="assets/testing/404-html.png" alt="image of W3C Html Validation result" >  | Pass   |


### Results W3C CSS Validation

In the table below the outputs of the W3C CSS Jigsaw Validation results. All tests passed. 


| Page     | Output       | Result |
| -------- |:------------:| ------:|
| Main     | <img src="./assets/testing/validation-css.png" alt="image of W3C Html Validation result" >  | Pass   |
| 404   |  <img src="assets/testing/404-css.png" alt="image of W3C Html Validation result" >  | Pass   |

### Results Jshint Javascript Validation 

In the table below the outputs of the JSHint Validation results. No significant errors occured. 

| File           | Result | Justificaction of insignificant errors  |
| -------------- | :----: | ----: |
| display.js     |  Pass  |  1 error : Class properties must be methods. I call this insignificant regarding the scope of the project. |
| external-d3.js |  Pass  |   4 errors  :  Missing "use strict" statement. I call that this is not a significant error in the context of this project as this was not covered by the course material up until now. I am aware that this is something that future version needs to address, but it dives beyond my current understanding of commonJS / ES6 to fix it at this point of the course.  |
| main.js        |  Pass  |   7 errors  : Missing "use strict" statement. insignificant regarding the project scope.  |
| simulation.js  |  Pass  |  1 Warning : Class properties must be methods. I call this insignificant regarding the scope of the project. |
| stick.js  |  Pass  |  Warning :  Class properties must be methods. Also tested with ESlint and this linter does not complain. |
| display.test.js       |  Pass  | 1 error  : Missing "use strict" statement. insignificant regarding the project scope.   |
| simulation.test.js       |  Pass  |  1 error left ‘document.write can be a form of eval.’ From the line document.write( fileContents). This line was copy + paste from the Code Institute Course Material, so i must assume that this is not a significant error.  |
| stick.test.js       |  Pass  |  1 error left Missing "use strict" statement - called insignficant for this project as per justification above|



 
### Results Unit Tests With Jest

In the screenshot below the outputs of the Jest Unit Test results. No errors occured. Code Coverage of the tests are not 100% but that is justified for this project since 
- Large parts of the front-ent are not included in the unit tests due to the use `d3.js` outside of a dedicated Front-end frameworks such as `vue` or `react` (as reasoned above) 
- The tests istself were not the strictest - being mindful about the time to complete this project I decided to have some of the functionality tested manually
- it is not within the assessment criteria of the project


| Page     | Output       | Result |
| -------- |:------------:| ------:|
| Results     | <img src="./assets/testing/unit-test-results.png" alt="image of output from Jest Unit Test" >  | Pass   |
| Coverage   |  <img src="assets/testing/unit-test-coverage-2.png" alt="image of output from Jest Unit Test using --coverage argument" >  | Pass   |

### Results Chrome Lighthouse 

The Chrome Lighthouse Tool integrated in the Chrome Developer Tools has been applied to test the performance and accessibility of each page.

For all pages, it suggest to serve static assets with an efficient cache policys.
Accessibility scores sufficiently high across all pages. 

Performance Score is a little low but for the scope of the project in an acceptable range. 

| Page     | Result       | 
| -------- |:------------:| 
| Main   | <img src="./assets/testing/validation-lighthouse.png" alt="image of result of chrome lighthouse test" >  | 
|        |  Performance scores a bit low.  Lighthouse suggests to serve static assets with an efficient cache policys. | 
| 404   |  <img src="./assets/testing/404-lighthouse-test.png" alt="image of result of chrome lighthouse test" >  | 
|        |  Performance scores a bit low. Lighthouse suggests to serve static assets with an efficient cache policys. |
